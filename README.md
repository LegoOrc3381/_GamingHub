- Difficulty levels determine:
  - Number range (e.g., 1–20, 1–50, 1–100)
  - Maximum number of attempts
  - Number and type of tips
- Entered numbers are displayed and collected in an overview
- Every 2–3 attempts, tips are displayed giving hints about the target number (e.g., math hints, previous guesses)
