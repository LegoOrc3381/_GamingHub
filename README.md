## Steps
1. *Run the Updater*  
   - Download the updater from the releases and start it.  
   - It will install or update GamingHub automatically.

2. **Start GamingHub**  
   - After installation, open `GamingHub.exe` in the same folder.  

**Warning:** Keep the updater, all related files, and any by the game created files in the same folder. Do not rename files, as the program accesses files using their names.

**Games:**
*Number Guessing*
- The player has to guess a number within a certain range (depending on difficulty)
- Difficulty levels determine:
  - Number range (e.g., 1–20, 1–50, 1–100)
  - Maximum number of attempts
  - Number and type of tips
- Entered numbers are displayed and collected in an overview
- Every 2–3 attempts, tips are displayed giving hints about the target number (e.g., math hints, previous guesses)
- Shows win or loss at the end
- After a game ends, the player can restart immediately
- Tracks progress: how often the player won or lost
